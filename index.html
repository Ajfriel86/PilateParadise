                <h3>PRIVATE PILATE SESSIONS</h3>
                <p>I offer one-to-one Pilates sessions to individuals who need help with a certain issue. We will
                    discuss your specific condition, what you wish to get out of Pilates, ahead of coming up with an
                    exercise plan going forward tailored to you.

                <h3>GROUP PILATE SESSIONS</h3>
                <p>Many prefer to practice Pilates in a group setting, and I offer a range of classes, running groups
                    consisting of anywhere between three or 15 people. These sessions are more general than one-to-one
                    Pilates, with an overall emphasis on toning muscles and stretching.

                <h3>ONLINE PILATE SESSIONS</h3>
                <p>Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, many have found Pilates online to be extremely useful, and even
                    preferable to in-person sessions. I run a number of zoom sessions every week, with recordings
                    available for people to have and use at their own pace whenever they like. Various packages are
                    available.
