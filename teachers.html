                <h3>Paula Murphy</h3>
                <p>Back in the 1990s, I worked at a gym based in Chelsea, London as a body pump PT, ahead of
                    becoming a
                    studio manager. During this time, I suffered a back injury, and I was encouraged to take a
                    Pilates
                    class. The impact was incredible; after just two sessions, my back was better, and my abs
                    started to
                    become toned as well. From that moment I was hooked and decided to become a qualified Pilates
                    teacher.
                    Returning to Galway in 1999, there were only three gyms in the city, none of which offered
                    Pilates.
                    There was little knowledge of its benefits, or even what it was, but soon that changed. I
                    started to
                    run classes of my own and the exercise, after a couple of years, started to really catch on,
                    with
                    many other Personal Trainers starting to train in Pilates as well. Now, over 20 years later,
                    Pilates
                    is an established exercise for men and women across Galway, and it always brings me joy seeing
                    others get the same benefits I experienced when I was younger and continue to enjoy now.</p>
